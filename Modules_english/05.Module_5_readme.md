## How to begin: 

To begin, go to https://colab.research.google.com/ 

Use of Colab is free. Note - There are limitations on the free version, but we will not reach these for our conversion purposes. 

On the Colab example home page, select "File", then "Open Notebook"

There is a Tab for "Github"; select that tab and paste 
```
https://github.com/lusacristan/Curso_SARS-CoV-2
```
into the search bar under "Enter a GitHub URL or search by organization or user" 

After a brief search, you will see
```
Modules_english/05.Module_5_interpretation.ipynb
```

You will see the template notebook open.

In order to run the cells, you will need to login with your Google account (it is free to make an account).
